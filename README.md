# seriate-example
Using The seriate NPM package to connect to a Microsoft SQL Express database version of the classic Northwind database. 

## Getting started. ##

Run npm install to get the seriate package. 

[Download][1] and run the Northwind database script.

Make sure your SQL Express database server is using the mix mode type of login. 

I found that it helped that the sql user has dbo.owner permissions and has full control of the database.
